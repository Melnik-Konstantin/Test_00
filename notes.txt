1. Git Initialization

git init → creates a new repository.

First branch created by default: master (can rename to main).

2. Files Created

README.md → project description.

app.py → contains print("Hello Git").

notes.txt → personal notes.

.gitignore → ignores files like *.log.

3. Commits Made

Added all initial files.

Modified app.py (added a new function).

Deleted notes.txt.

Added .gitignore.

Added dummy log file and confirmed Git ignores it.

4. Commands Practiced

git status → check current changes.

git add <file> → stage changes.

git commit -m "message" → commit changes.

git log --graph --oneline → visualize history.

git checkout -- <file> → undo changes in a file.

5. Lessons Learned

Git tracks changes, not just files.

Staging area is important before committing.

.gitignore prevents unwanted files from being tracked.

History visualization helps understand branch flow.

Undoing changes can be done safely with checkout.
